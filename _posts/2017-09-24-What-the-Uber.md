The piece analyses reasons behind and consequences of London banning Uber.

London has banned the uber app. To understand the influence of Uber in a cit like London, we would have to understand what modern public transport system does to the notion of space for a human being. 

If you are sitting in a room, you are likely to be able to move in three dimensions or three directions - left or right, forward or backwards and up or down. So, you can grab the coffee on the right, pick up a pen from the floor and walk forward with your cup of coffee. If there is table blocking your way, you can just walk around it. In our homes, the effective space is the one that is not blocked by an object. 

When you move outside your home, space is still three-dimensional, but it effectively becomes two-dimensional. Assuming, of course, you are a normal muggle and cannot fly. Effective space remains a two-dimensional notion that around objects. For short distances that you can walk, there are obstacles like hedges, cars and walls that you can walk around and make your way. 

As the distance increases, space is no longer the residual unblocked two-dimensional space. Conversely, it becomes a notion of facilitated movement. Almost like tunnels created through space which suck you in on one end and spit you out on the other end. Moving through space at this distance is costly. Your reasonably priced mode of transport could be buses on the road, tube on the tube line, rail on railways like and aeroplanes from one airport to another. 


Moving unconstrained through space is possible with taxis and cars but it is quite expensive in a crowded city like London. What Uber did when it emerged a few years ago is that it dramatically changed the notion of space dramatically decreasing the cost of freely through the two-dimensional space. It allowed people to move freely across space and thus changed their relationship with the space around them. The problem is that in doing so, it also acquired a larger than life image in our heads, almost akin to Stockholm syndrome, where the captor sympathises with their less benevolent captor. Of course, Uber was not exactly a captor, it was a company like other tech behemoths that had huge social influence and instead of being developing a long-term sustainable relationship with the society it was doing business, it decided to cut corners and think large of the pecuniary income stream that their predominant position was going to be able to generate. This may be due to the insecurity the disruptive tech starts up to have about being disrupted by another new tech kid on the block.

Having taken almost an enviable natural monopolist's position in the London market, it refused to grow up and deal with its social responsibilities. Like any new social change, it did provide us with a vital service, but, without the safeguards that people in the developed world expect from their service providers. In its heady brashness, it also effectively thwarted the ability the of the state to provide the necessary safeguards by providing the police with the information about sexual assaults in when the customers reported it to the Uber. Here is also something interesting about the psychological hold the company has on its customers that they think that it suffices to complain to the company about something as serious as sexual assault.
